        If you are not happy with your purchase, we will accept a return of a
        unused product within 14 days. Once we receive the returned item
        LetUsMaintain will then give a full refund (excluding shipping as we are
        unable to refund the initial shipping cost of your order). Our Return &
        Refund Policy was created by Return Refund Policy Template for
        www.letusmaintain.com <br />
